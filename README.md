## Overview

This is the last project i take before the devchallenges.io down (for just a couple day). 
This lil project is fun. One challenging part is to create the right status box and make it responsive and also a custom ordered list. Check the [demo](https://pandagenduts-recipe-page.netlify.app/) on how i did it :)
